  'Bushidō (武士道, "the way of the warrior") is a moral code concerning samurai attitudes, behavior and lifestyle. Bushido formalized earlier samurai moral values and ethical code, most commonly stressing a combination of sincerity, frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery and honour until death. Born from Neo-Confucianism during times of peace in the Edo period (1603-1868) and following Confucian texts, while also being influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism, it allowed the violent existence of the samurai to be tempered by wisdom, patience and serenity.',
  "Justice is a core value of any warrior, not just the Samurai. Incorporating this principle into your life requires constant reflection of fairness and always being accountable with regard to moral character.",
  "Courage, is often misunderstood as to meaning lack of fear. This is not the case, it is more about doing what is right, irrespective of fear. It does require trying to work out what is right and wrong. Courage requires the strength to perceive something as being right and then act accordingly.",
  "Compassion is the basis of love and through this understanding have the ability to demonstrate sympathy and patience to yourself as well as others, i.e., looking at issues from another person’s perspective. This especially relates to and is important for those in a leadership role.",
  "Respect needs to be given to be received, and it starts with yourself. From then you have the experience to acknowledge others and their experiences and feelings. To be able to work with others common courtesy and politeness should always be used.",
  "This is the ‘quality of being honest and having strong moral principles’ it is often a misunderstood concept. It is the thread that connects and provides purpose to the other principles for the warrior. This mean living congruently with honesty and sincerity.",
  "This revolves around a warrior’s moral compass. It is the quality of knowing and doing what is morally right and having the self-worth to live by this code of conduct every day. It requires that the warrior has identified their own moral guidelines and understands the responsibilities that is needed to be followed.",
  "This is the outcome from the other principles, with the challenge being to stay on the path yourself, irrespective of the challenges. When a warrior gives their word whether it is to a person or a cause, this must not be abandoned even under difficult circumstances. This is something that has been forgotten in society today.",
  "Self-control is not included in every listing of the Bushido code. Self-control or self-discipline is about doing what is right no matter what the circumstances, when with others and when alone. We often see when this is missing with our leaders having two sets of behavior, one for them and one for others.",
